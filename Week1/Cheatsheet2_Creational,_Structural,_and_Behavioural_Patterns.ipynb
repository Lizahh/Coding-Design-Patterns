        "* One of the most famous books on the topic is Design Patterns: **Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software.**\n",
        "\n",
        "* This book was written by four authors who were given the nickname, **The Gang of Four**.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The Gang of Four wrote their book based on their experience as developers. Each of them had created their own programs and graphics applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "  While doing this, they noticed repeating patterns in their designs. Together, they decided to organize these patterns into a helpful guide. The patterns are easy to read and have names that explain their purpose.\n",
        "\n",
        "* A simple example of a pattern is defining and calling methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "* When patterns are grouped together to solve a specific type of problem, they form a Pattern Language. The pattern language you use depends on the problem you are solving.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* When designing games, you might use a different pattern language than if you were creating accounting software.\n",
        "\n",
        "* For games, you have designed words such as encounters, quests, and players. These words are important in design patterns for game software, but would not be found in design patterns for accounting software.\n",
        "\n",
        "* In accounting software, double entry bookkeeping is a vital design solution to reduce errors, and ensure consistency in the transactions. Double entry bookkeeping would not need to be defined in the pattern language for game design.\n",
        "\n",
        "* There are 23 patterns found in the Gang of Four's catalog. We will describe the **categories of patterns** that book defined.\n"
